      <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I'm 26. I can be timid or a conversationalist, depending if I've had my caffeine. Although I can't say I'm funny myself, I do enjoy laughs and appreciate the good things.
          <br>Open-minded and huge advocate for growth; I value meeting others and sharing our perspectives on the universe. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
        <p>I am Orange County born and raised.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
        <p>Consuming art, dabbling with music, and dancing are a necessity in my life,
          <br>but you can also find me cooking, building things, talking about Marvel theories, or playing games mostly to admire the evolution in design.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
        <p>I would love to be a movie director or founder of an art school. A job that would allow me to meet aspiring creatives and provide the confidence and resources necessary to aid them on their path.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
        <p>I have stayed in Fullerton and Los Angeles in the past, but I currently reside in Westminster.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
        <p>Firstly, my interest in web development stemmed from growing up with the internet and watching it grow into this behemoth of unlimited potential. I love how the evolution of the web has revolutionized my generation in access to knowledge and expression in creativity.
          <br>Secondly, it has always been a part of me to find purpose in helping people find their identity. Through web development, I wish to become someone who can open up aspiring artists to the world and creat a place for them to present themselves, present their brand, and tell their story. </p>
